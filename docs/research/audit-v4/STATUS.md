# AnthroSim scientific audit v4 — status ledger

Audit target: immutable AnthroSim `v0.3.4`, tag commit `8996e99ffc4c5b91b9e00d1048eedd4227ea1d09`, model semantics `anthrosim-model-semantics-v25`.

Protocol: `docs/research/scientific-audit-protocol.md`

Charter: `docs/research/audit-v4/README.md`

Purpose: durable repository-authoritative state for the fourth independent/adversarial comprehensive scientific audit and the fresh post-Audit-v3 convergence pass.

## Current baseline and state

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Audit generation | v4 / fourth independent scientific audit |
| Immutable discovery target | `v0.3.4` |
| Target tag SHA | `8996e99ffc4c5b91b9e00d1048eedd4227ea1d09` |
| Target software version | `0.3.4` |
| Target model semantics | `anthrosim-model-semantics-v25` |
| Coverage state | **0/14 Areas complete — discovery initialized** |
| Current P0 findings | none discovered |
| Current P1 findings | none discovered |
| Current P2 findings | none discovered |
| Current P3 findings | none discovered |
| Convergence classification | **pending full A–N discovery** |
| Repair state | **discovery only; do not repair v4 findings until A–N discovery completes** |

## Discovery rule

- The immutable `v0.3.4` tag is the scientific discovery target.
- Audit v2/v3 evidence is historical context and regression-hypothesis material only.
- Each Area starts incomplete and requires fresh evidence.
- Preserve demonstrated defects in issues and this ledger before repair.
- Continue later Areas against the frozen v0.3.4 baseline even after findings are discovered.
- Production repair is deferred until A–N discovery is complete, absent an explicitly documented integrity emergency.

### 2026-09-02 — Audit v4 initialization

- Frozen target selected: `v0.3.4` / `8996e99ffc4c5b91b9e00d1048eedd4227ea1d09` / semantics v25.
- Reusable scientific audit protocol reviewed.
- Audit-v3 charter and ledger reviewed as historical context only.
- Audit-v4 coverage initialized at zero.
- Recommended first substantive area: **Area A — authoritative semantics and scheduler behaviour**, beginning with fresh scheduler/simultaneity/order-invariance attacks against v25 and targeted regression attacks on the integrated v3 repair line.
